**How ChatGPT Will Destabilize White-Collar Work**

No technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly educated

workers. Will generative AI be an exception?

**1.**There you have it, I guess: ChatGPT is coming for my job and yours, according to



<a name="br5"></a> 

ChatGPT itself. The artificially intelligent content creator, whose name is short for “Chat

Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” was released two months ago by OpenAI, one of

the country’s most influential artificial-intelligence research laboratories. The

technology is, put simply, amazing. It generated that first paragraph instantly, working

with this prompt: “Write a five-sentence paragraph in the style of The Atlantic about

whether AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers in the next

five years.”

**2.**ChatGPT is just one of many mind-blowing generative AI tools released recently,

including the image generators Midjourney and DALL-E and the video generator

Synthesia. The upside of these AI tools is easy to see: They’re going to produce a

tremendous amount of digital content, quickly and cheaply. Students are already using

ChatGPT to help them write essays. Businesses are using ChatGPT to create copy for

their websites and promotional materials, and to respond to customer-service inquiries.

Lawyers are using it to produce legal briefs (ChatGPT passes the torts and evidence



<a name="br6"></a> 

sections of the Multistate Bar Examination, by the way) and academics to produce

footnotes.

**3.**Yet an extraordinary downside is also easy to see: What happens when services like

ChatGPT start putting copywriters, journalists, customer-service agents, paralegals,

coders, and digital marketers out of a job? For years, tech thinkers have been warning

that flexible, creative AI will be a threat to white-collar employment, as robots replace

skilled office workers whose jobs were once considered immune to automation. In the

most extreme iteration, analysts imagine AI altering the employment landscape

permanently. One Oxford study estimates that 47 percent of U.S. jobs might be at risk.

**4.**No single technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly

educated workers. Will generative AI really be an exception? No one can answer this



<a name="br7"></a> 

question, given how new the technology is and given how slowly employment can

adjust in response to technological change. But AI really is different, technology

experts told me—a range of tasks that up until now were impossible to automate are

becoming automatable. “Before, progress was linear and predictable. You figured out

the steps and the computer followed them. It followed the procedure; it didn’t learn and

it didn’t improvise,” the MIT professor David Autor, one of the world’s foremost experts

on employment and technological change, told me. ChatGPT and the like do improvise,

promising to destabilize a lot of white-collar work, regardless of whether they eliminate

jobs or not.

**5.**People and businesses are just figuring out how to use emerging AI technologies, let

alone how to use them to create new products, streamline their business operations,

and make employees more efficient. If history is any guide, this process could take

longer than you might think. Consider electricity. The circuit, electric lights, and



<a name="br8"></a> 

rudimentary electric motors were developed in the early 1800s. But another century

passed before the widespread adoption of electricity in the United States began to lift

GDP. Or take computers. They became commercially available in the early 1950s but

did not show up in the productivity stats until the late 1990s.

**6.**Some technologies clearly improve productivity and reduce the need for labor.

Automated machine tools, for instance, depress manufacturing employment while

lifting output and productivity, as do many of the forms of machinery invented and

employed since the Industrial Revolution. But other technologies—even amazing

ones—show surprisingly muted effects. How about the internet, which has

revolutionized almost every facet of communications in the past four decades? Despite

altering how we date and talk and read and watch and vote and emote and record our

own life stories, launching a zillion businesses, and creating however many fortunes,

the internet “fails the hurdle test as a Great Invention,” the economist Robert Gordon



<a name="br9"></a> 

argued in 2000, because it “provides information and entertainment more cheaply and

conveniently than before, but much of its use involves substitution of existing activities

from one medium to another.” Nearly a quarter century later, the internet still hasn’t

spurred a productivity revolution. Smartphones haven’t either.

**7.**So is AI like the smartphone or is it like an automated machine tool? Is it about to

change the way that work gets done without eliminating many jobs in aggregate, or is

it about to turn San Francisco into the Rust Belt?

**8.**Predicting where technology will cause job losses is hard, Autor noted. Remember

the freak-out several years ago over the possibility of self-driving automobiles

eliminating work for truck drivers? But AI is much more flexible than a system like Excel,

much more creative than a Google Doc. What’s more, AI systems get better and better



<a name="br10"></a> 

and better as they get more use and absorb more data, whereas engineers often need

to laboriously and painstakingly update other types of software.

**9.**As a rule, when companies can substitute machines for people, they will. AI can do

work currently done by paralegals, copywriters, digital-content producers, executive

assistants, entry-level computer programmers, and, yes, some journalists. That means

such jobs might change, and soon. But even if ChatGPT can spit out a pretty good

paragraph on AI, it can’t interview AI and labor experts, nor can it find historical

documents, nor can it assess the quality of studies of technological change and

employment. It creates content out of what is already out there, with no authority, no

understanding, no ability to correct itself, no way to identify genuinely new or interesting

ideas. That implies that AI might make original journalism more valuable and

investigative journalists more productive, while creating an enormous profusion of

simpler content. AI might spit out listicles and summaries of public meetings, while



<a name="br11"></a> 

humans will write in-depth stories. “In many ways, AI will help people use expertise

better,” Autor said. “It means that we’ll specialize more.”

**10.**AI could also make a wide variety of industries more efficient, with muted effects on

overall employment. Matt Wampler is a co-founder of an AI-powered small business

called ClearCOGS. He’s been a “restaurant guy” his whole career, he told me.

Restaurants and grocery stores, he says, tend to run on thin margins, yet still tend to

waste a considerable amount of food. People order more spaghetti than burgers; buns

get thrown out. “Restaurants just lag behind on technology,” he told me. “They’re all

about people. It’s people serving people; it’s people managing people. And in that very

human-centric world, the default way of handling problems is to hand it to a person.

Phil’s going to do it.”



<a name="br12"></a> 

**11.**ClearCOGS takes restaurants’ customer-order history, supply data, and labor data

and uses AI-powered modeling to make their books leaner and more profitable. If

people are starting to order more spaghetti than burgers, the system will prompt the

chef or manager to buy more pasta and fewer rolls. “We put this in place in some of

my cousin’s sandwich shops,” Wampler told me. “Simple answers to simple questions.

The question they needed answered was, there’s an assistant manager on the night

shift and a couple hours before close, he has to decide whether to bake another tray

of bread or not. We provide that answer.” This use of ChatGPT isn’t eliminating human

jobs, really; neighborhood sandwich joints aren’t hiring McKinsey consultants. But it

might make food service more efficient as a whole.

**12.**Even if it doesn’t boost the economy, AI could still change the texture of our lives

and alter how we spend our time, like social media did before it. Video games might

become more immersive. Shops might have far better copywriting and sales visuals.



<a name="br13"></a> 

Movies might look cooler. Videos in the depths of YouTube might become far weirder

and more beautiful. We might also see far more formulaic content than we already do.

(Much more ominously, there might be a huge amount of plausible-seeming

disinformation online.)

**13.**For workers, Autor noted, the great risk is that AI technologies cause too sudden a

change in what kind of labor employers want. Certain specializations might get wiped

out, leaving thousands of call-center operators or marketing workers unemployed. But

he stressed the benefits of having such technology in our hands. Productivity has

languished for decades. Machines doing a little more work would have a big upside,

after all.
